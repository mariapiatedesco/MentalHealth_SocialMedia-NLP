The only relief I get is sleep.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t have as many anxious thoughts like I used to but I am under a lot of stress with work.

I was drunk at a party and a friend was there who had betrayed me(long story) and she kept following me around saying \\\"oh so you cant say hi to me? Oh you must be so much better then me.\\\" She even follosed me to the bathroom and yelled through the door. I am very tall so ive never been physically intimidated. So i swung open the door and said \\\"outside. Now.\\\" \\n\\nWe got outside and she just kept taking sayongnhorrible things that mind of went over my head. But she said one thing that erupted the volcanoe. Let me say again that this was my very first physical interaction. \\n\\nShe said sarcastically, \\\"oh and by the way im soooooo sorry that i actually have a family that cares about me instead of having one that doesnt give a shit about me(referring to me).\\n\\nThe next moment is something so intense and so surreal and so not who i am.\\n\\nI lunged at her AND WRAPPED MY HANDS AROUND HET NECK AND STARTED CHOKING HER. I said to her in this low voice ive never \\\"one day you wake up all aloneand have no one to blame but yourself\\\".\\nshe could still get in air a little. This was for about 8 seconds untils our friends broke us up. She told everyone i tried to kill her. But i had new group of friends who were at that party and didnt know how she got there. \\n\\nAfter this happened i ran to my boyfriends house where him and his friends were just chillin. And I yelled at Taylor(bf) outside the hpuse to come down. He saw me shaking and walked me to the beach to calm down. I told him everything and I kept saying \\\"thats not who I am. Thats not who I am\\\". I felt so ashamed of myself but everyone told me i did the right thing cuz they hated her too. But i felt that i definitly didnt do the right thing. \\n\\nAnd i hated thinkinh the thought \\\"why did I choke her when I could have punched her\\\".\\n\\nAnd then i remember ed my dad used to choke me. \\n\\nMy second time was when i was 24. Worked my ass off to geet to a university. I got in and i was so happy there. Yet one day, my dormmate came in and said \\\"there is a man in the parking lot saying he is your father amd wants to see you.\\\" Immediatly i told her to call campus security. Suddenly i staryed feeling the rage. I was away from him for 7 years. So this was a nightmare. Especially whem i knew he lived 4 hours away. It was nighttime and i went to the parking lot. Once a s ary 6'4\\\"  350 pound man now looking like big lebowski and at most 130 pounds. He began to walk towards me. I blacked out. My roommate said I started flapping my arms like to scare away geese and ran toward yelling over and over \\\"IM GONNA KILL YOU DEMON!!\\\" And lunged toward him with speed. apparently it chased him off. My  roommate told me she fpund me hyperventalting and laying on the concrete in fetal. She brpught me to ved and o giess she said my dad was down the road but hes a cop so he got off.\\n\\nSo i really am so confused on what to do to make sure i dont see red again. I dont want violence.

Cheating, talking to other people, sending nudes online, etc. I've always taken good care of then, given them everything they wanted, stayed faithful to them, everything. Fast forward to now, come home one day and they're gone. Completely vanished. Just walked out on everything. I start doing research and find out they are an avoidant. Won't face me and give me any answers, won't take responsibility for the mess they've made, won't do anything but throw shade and bad energy my way. My general question is, how do I handle someone with BPD and avoidant issues when they're going through serious trauma, partly of which I caused, and do these type of people ever come back? We were planning a future together, and not only breaks my heart that they'd just walk out, but am also concerned about their wellbeing, because they are very easy suaed and their mind changed, and they are out there all on their own. General tips on how to approach this situation, because it seems everything I do is wrong to them, but I can tell they aren't in their right mind. Help please?\",\n          \"Why do I allow this?

I will try to answer your question concerning these things instead. \\n\\nMost of the time I justified my lies by telling myself they were necessary. I classified them as white lies even if they weren't. I successfully convinced myself that I needed to lie because it would protect me from worse situations. These \\\"worse things\\\" mostly involved me feeling something I didn't want. For example if I made a mistake and I didn't want to feel guilty about it, I lied about it, gaslighted people or blamed someone else. I found that was fine because it protected me from feeling bad. Some other stuff are things that I did just because it helped me or I liked it. That sounds evil as f*ck and it is. I won't deny that. I wanted it, so I did it. \\n\\nNote: An important reason for all that is being intensely damaged by childhood experiences and me thinking that I need to do anything to protect myself from any more negative feelings.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answer_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 457,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"thank you so much  i needed to hear that its so unbelievably hard i just couldnt fathom this type of pain in a million years\",\n          \"Theres many difficult components in here Im not sure about making sure someones really honest As long as he cant prove his words to be true and as long as you dont have evidence for it to be untrue its his word against yours \\n\\nAn important question would be why you feel like you need to ask him about his masturbation habits and porn use and why he needs to tell you about it Thats very intimate subjects Its possible that he lies about it because he feels uncomfortable telling someone and wants to keep it to himself which he has the right to Of course he still doesnt have the right to lie he should then say Id rather keep that to myself and Im uncomfortable with questions about it Maybe you can ask him if thats the case Instead of telling him that you wont judge him try asking what your questions make him feel and if hes okay with you asking\\n\\nOther than that its possible that former partners have judged him for masturbating and using porn which can lead to him not trusting you even if you assure him that you wont judge Chances for this case are high if he gets very defensive about his habits acting like a cornered animal\\n\\nAlso try asking yourself why you feel the need to know about his masturbation habits Do you feel like his masturbation habits are damaging to your shared sex life What is this actually about\\n\\nAbout the female coworker What exactly is your fear Do you think he cheats on you with her What makes you think that Does he have a history of cheating More details could help If he lies about her things you could pay attention to might be Does he try to distract you and change the subject when you ask about her Does he counter questions for example Oh and what about your male friendcoworker XY \\n\\nIf he builds untrue stories you might pay attention to if he can change the way he tells them If I make something up I usually repeat it in the exact same way when Im asked about it again I do that to make sure that I dont unintentionally change a detail For example I will constantly repeat I went to the bowling park with Max Tim and Corey instead of saying I went to the bowling park with my friends or with Max and the others People who tell the truth dont tell it in the exact same way over and over again usually They spare or add details and change wordings\",\n          \"Thank you so much for your words I feel like a prisioner a slave in my own life Im trying to have this support from everyone close friends that watched and heard what she did said shes narcissist and has been manipulating me But I really really feel afraid of carrying the guilty Id feel if she kills herself Its so hard Im sorry\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

I'm suffering from burn-out symptoms and have a fear of failing (idk is this has a name), especially when it comes to school. I am currently only doing 2 subjects, maths and chemistry, so that next year I can go to university. \\n\\nIts been almost 2 years since I started having burn-out/stress symptoms. I cry alot, get stressed by tiny things. So when I make a mistake in my calculations in maths or something, it is possible for my to start crying and have a semi-panick attack. I am seeing a psychologist so I am getting some help. \\n\\nBut at home it is different, I still live with my parents and lil sister. My mum tries to help by saying, \\\"oh its only two subjects no need to worry, dont be so stressed\\\" and other quotes like that, my dad does the same. But this is only making my fears and stress worse, it makes me feel like I am being silly for feeling like this and not good enough for these subjects. When I tried talking to my mum about it she told me that she cant help it if I am interpretatting it negatively and that I shouldnt think like that and she got a bit mad. I just said \\\"okey\\\" as I didnt know what to do and felt now worse than before. \\n\\nMy stress has gotten so bad now that sometimes I have a semi-panick attack over minor things, like talking to strangers, when my parents tell me to do something, small changes in my schedule etc.  \\n\\nNow we (me and my family) are going on vacation soon and I'm getting really stressed about it because my tests are really short after and when I try to tell my parents how stressed I am they just start again with the oh its only two subjects thing and get a little mad when I say I dont want to go with them.\\n\\nAll this has brought some tension between me and my parents and I really dont know how to talk with them about this anymore. Everytime I start thinking about it I start crying and all that. \\n\\nDo any of you have some advise for me?\\n\\nSorry for the long story, sorry if its written a bit hasty. I'm trying to do homework but keep having small panick attacks.\",\n          \"Back from sick leave, about to throw up from stress Already did two posts on here about the coffee shop I work at.\\n\\nIt's gotten worse.\\n\\nOur bosses just don't care.\\n\\nWe had to wait for a MONTH for them to come fix the heater and still with it on it's cold as fuck. They never come to check anything, we have to do everything on our own, we're always out of one thing or another because they can't handle stock, and all the backlash from the customers come to US since they're never here.\\n\\nWe've had rats for months chewing everything they could: milk bottles, straws, coffee beans bags and cocoa powder, everything they could.\\nThe bosses didn't lift a finger and waited for them to die on their own. One of them did, behind a fridge, and the smell was rancid. We told them several times and it took them 3 days to come check on it (we didn't know where the smell came from and why). \\n\\nMy therapist put me on sick leave since my mental health was absolutely shit because of this work environment. \\n\\nNow I'm back. And my boss asked us to tell her when we're available for a phone call because she needs to talk to us.\\n\\nThe anxiety makes me want to throw up because I know we slacked off, but everyone is tired, we're paid crap (one of our colleague didn't even get paid last month because they \\\"couldn't afford it\\\"), everyone wants out of this shithole. I stg, if I'm going to get yelled at like she does I'm going to lose it.\\n\\nIf I don't lose it before that.\\n\\nUNEXPECTED UPDATE: The shop is closing for good at the end of March.
